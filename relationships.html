        <h2>Relationships</h2>
        <p>
          Throughout life we have different relationships with people. They may change from time to time and this is why relationships could be a very complex area. Making and maintaining relationships takes effort. It means there are things that all parties in the particular relationship should do to keep that relationship going.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having positive, ‘healthy’ relationships is good for you. People in supportive, loving relationships are more likely to feel healthier, happier and satisfied with their lives and less likely to have emotional or physical health problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are some generally useful suggestions, and also some advice on particular behaviours that may not be helpful in relationships. Think of any particular relationship you currently have. They may include some of the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Friends</li>
          <li>Parents</li>
          <li>Siblings</li>
          <li>Family</li>
          <li>Intimate relationships with a partner</li>
          <li>Flatmates</li>
          <li>Work colleagues</li>
          <li>Tutors/Lecturers/Supervisors</li>
          <li>Peers and acquaintances</li>
          <li>Online relationships</li>
          <li>How you relate to yourself</li>
          <li>Your ‘relationship’ with your academic work</li>
          <li>Your connection with RGU</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          All of these are very different types of relationships. If you are struggling with one of these think about where you are at in your other relationships. Do you relate to a person/people differently in one relationship compared to how you feel in the other one? An obvious answer would be yes as we do not react the same when talking to a tutor than if talking to a boy-/girlfriend or a parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Think about how you make some relationships work and try and apply that to other more difficult relationships. Also think how you would prefer to be treated if you were your friend, parent, flat mate?
        </p>
        <p>
          All relationships require both parties to work at maintaining them. Smile to people! The best time to learn to create a good relationship is at the start of the relationship. Begin with showing respect for the other person’s opinion, views. At the same time do not accept any negative gestures towards yourself and invite the other person into a positive discussion about your different views. This can feel hard for you to do at university as you have left the familiarity of your home relationships, and you do not know other people’s reactions and how they see you. Not knowing can lead to anxiety and this can make you feel less sure of what you want or how you should act or expect others to react. Staying confident in yourself and keeping a positive attitude towards building new friendships would help.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you had good relationships before coming to RGU think about how you were maintaining your good relationship? Was it always your positive contribution to the relationship? How did you encourage other people to contribute to the relationship? If you have certain relationship skills what worked for you before you could use them in the new RGU setting and see if it works again!
        </p>
        <p>
          Also when a relationship is going well, it is important that you still put effort into it and don't take the relationship for granted. Encourage others to do the same by sharing with them your appreciation for being a good friend or tutor. Think of what you need in a relationship and openly discuss it where possible and encourage other people to do so. This way, your relationships have the best chance of growing and continuing to be strong and healthy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are in a difficult situation and you want to make some changes talk to people you trust, your parents, good friends or a counsellor at RGU. Also it is crucial, if you feel unsafe in a relationship, ask for help. Be aware that different conflicts are an inevitable part of human relationships but you must not tolerate any disrespect, abuse or violence in any of your relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main suggestion is to treat others as you would like to be treated by them.
