          <h3>About This Website</h3>
          <p>My name is Jo and I am one of the academic staff in the School of Engineering at RGU. I am also undertaking a PhD in the Mental Wellbeing of Engineering Students. As part of my research I discovered that engineering students and students in similar disciplines like computing and construction can suffer from very poor mental wellbeing but rarely ask for help.</p>
          <p>After some work with students and staff from 5 different universities, we developed this site, which is the start of building a useful resource for people who don’t like asking for help in the ways universities offer.</p>
          <p>It is very much a work in progress, and we are hoping that you can give us feedback on what works and what doesn’t, what could be added and what could be removed. It is a resource for you after all!</p>
          <p>On the webpages you will see quotes and facts from research papers looking at supporting mental health and wellbeing in engineering students (and others!). The suggestions and activities here are all supported by peer reviewed research projects, and the aim is to provide you with the know-how and support to improve or maintain your mental wellbeing and to give you confidence to know when to ask for more help if you need it.</p>
          <p>The site is hosted “off” RGU pages so you don’t have to log into Moodle to access them. While we do have some links to Moodle content that will require a login, we have no way to identify who you are. This means your visits here are confidential. We are collecting anonymous visit data like how often and when a page or item is accessed. We also have a <a href="https://rguecho.herokuapp.com/feedback.html">feedback option</a> if you would like to suggest improvements or tell us something that has worked well. This also is anonymous although we do ask for some demographic data to help with our report – it’s not compulsory to fill that in, but it helps!</p>

              <p class="card-text">Hi I'm the Inclusion and Counselling Manager within Student Life at RGU. I've worked at RGU for almost 24 years and in that time I've seen a huge increase in the numbers of students disclosing mental health issues. I want to support this project to make sure students know what help is available and how to get support if they need it. I'm also keen that we give students the tools they need to maintain their own wellbeing, both while they study with us, and for the future.</p>

I'm also a School Ambassador and am taking part in lots of different things to do with the School and beyond. I've been working on this project and the one before it because I think it's really important that students are supported in ways they are comfortable using.</p>

Having been a student not too long ago I remember how taxing being a student can be on your mental health, and also how hard it can be to talk about these subjects with your friends on the course. Hopefully this website can act as a starting point!</p>

I'm a mental health first aider and happy to talk to anyone wanting to talk about mental health and wellbeing.</p>

I work with what is most important to you personally, and work with you to agree realistic goals, checking in on how effective the work is towards the goals as we go. We offer space for you to untangle your thoughts and help you develop ways that you can support yourself in the future. I am helping on this project because we don't see many engineering or computing students and it's quite possible we can give you tools you can use for a long time.</p>

We have worked to create a safe space that will provide wellbeing information and coping strategies for common mental health issues.</p>
